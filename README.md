**Pico barrel organ forget-me-not** 

We want to run a mini barrel organ with a Pi Pico.

Step 1: Pico drives a motor that drives the mini barrel organ  

Step 2: Mini barrel organ is operated by hand. Pico Pi noticed the rotation.

Step 3: The Pi Pico is controlled by Wifi.

Step 4: When the Pi Pico is operated and mini barrel organ is playing, it connects to other similar devices that drive their motor and operate their mini barrel organ.

What we need:
- Mini barrel organ  
- Pi Pico  
- L298N Motor Drive Controller Board  
- Motor 60 rpm  
- ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi Module (or new Pi Pico W)
