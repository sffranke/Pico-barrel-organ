**Pico barrel organ** 

We want to run a mini barrel organ with a Pi Pico.

Step 1: Pico drives a motor that drives the mini barrel organ  

Step 2: Mini barrel organ is operated by hand. Pico Pi noticed the rotation.

Step 3: The Pi Pico is controlled by Wifi.

Step 4: When the Pi Pico is manually operated, it connects to other similar devices that drive their motor and operate their mini barrel organ.

What we need:
- Mini barrel organ  
- Pi Pico  
- L298N Motor Drive Controller Board  
- Motor 60 rpm  
- ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi Module (or new Pi Pico W)
